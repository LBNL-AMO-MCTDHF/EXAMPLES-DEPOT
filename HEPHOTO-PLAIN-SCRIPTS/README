./Relax.Bat

   then

./Fourier.Bat
./Flux.Bat 500
./gnu.xsec

   or

./Fourier.Perp.Bat
./Flux.Perp.Bat 500
./gnu.xsec.perp

   Also you can run Flux.Bats during Fourier run; 
specify a final time (not 500) not exceeding the last time already calculated.

   This is now a two-step process; Pulse.Bat has been eliminated.  You can
run Pulsecheck.Bat to verify that the flux is not absorbed much before the
pulse is over.
