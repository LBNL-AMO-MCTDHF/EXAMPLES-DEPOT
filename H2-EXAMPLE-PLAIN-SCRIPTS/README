./Relax.Bat
./Cation.Bat

   then

./Fourier.Bat
./Flux.Bat 500
./ProjFlux.Bat 500
./gnu.xsec
./gnu.proj.xsec
./gnu.abs.par

   or

./Fourier.Perp.Bat
./Flux.Perp.Bat 500
./ProjFlux.Perp.Bat 500
./gnu.xsec.perp
./gnu.proj.xsec.perp
./gnu.abs.perp

You can run Flux.Bats during Fourier run; specify a final time (500 for 
example) not exceeding the last time already calculated.  Calculation goes 
to 1000.

   This is now a two-step process; Pulse.Bat has been eliminated.  You can
run Pulsecheck.Bat to verify that the flux is not absorbed much before the
pulse is over.
