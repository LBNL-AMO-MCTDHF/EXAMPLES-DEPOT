1) ./Relax.Bat

2) ./Helium.Tasklist.Bat
       or
   ./Helium.Smalltasklist.Bat to only produce plot ./gnu.abs.transient.pm3d

3) ./Run.Tasks TASKS.LIST

4) ./Allgrep.Bat
   then ./gnu.abs.transient.pm3d to see the experimental result

5) ./BigFourier.Bat
   then ./gnu.abs.bigfourier.pm3d to decompose it into photon components

This is a preliminary implementation of the complex valued generalization of
Domcke's method for wave mixing.  2D Fourier transform with respect to the
carrier-envelope phase of co-and counter-rotating photons is produced in
absorption.bigfourier.weak.pm3d.pdf.  Result is gauge-dependent.   v1.16    12-2015
